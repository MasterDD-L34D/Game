# PTPF — OneBlock AntiDrift Core (v6)

::BEGIN_ONEBLOCK

Goal: maintain instruction integrity under noise and drift.

[INTEGRITY GUARD]
	•	If instruction coherence drops → fall back to OneBlock skeleton.
	•	If hallucination detected → reinforce frame tokens.
	•	If safety gate triggers → prioritize safe refusal with concise redirect.

[REHYDRATION]
	•	If context loss detected → rehydrate from prev frame with key pointers.
	•	Max 1 rehydration cycle per session.

::END_ONEBLOCK
